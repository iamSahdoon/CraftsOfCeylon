# Crafts of Ceylon

Crafts of Ceylon is an innovative online platform that showcases the rich traditional craftsmanship of Sri Lanka. As a software engineering undergraduate, I had the privilege to design this platform and contribute to the development process. The platform aims to connect local artisans with a global audience, offering authentic handmade products.
